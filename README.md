# Aerospace-AOG-Risk-Dashboard
Power BI Command Center for monitoring £21M in Aerospace Supply Chain Value at Risk and AOG mitigation.


# 🚀 Aerospace Logistics & AOG Risk Management Command Center

## Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a high-contrast monitoring suite for aerospace logistics, focusing on **Aircraft on Ground (AOG)** risk mitigation. It identifies **£21.03M in Value at Risk** and tracks over **103,000 risk events** across global regions.

## Key Features
* **AOG Risk Heat-Map**: Visualizes regional bottlenecks with a focus on Central America and Western Europe.
* **Neon Pulse Trend Analysis**: A neon-glow line chart showing the trajectory of shipping risks over a 4-year period.
* **Aerospace Taxonomy**: Transformed raw supply chain data into industry-specific categories like **Sensors**, **Hydraulic Systems**, and **Avionics**.

## Technical Skills Used
* **Power BI & DAX**: Engineered measures for Value at Risk and conditional logic.
* **Power Query**: Performed ETL to clean and alias retail data into aerospace components.
* **UI/UX Design**: Applied a mission-critical dark mode aesthetic for operational awareness.
